# Homepage

The homepage is the main page of the website once users log in via SSO. It contains critical information primarily targeted at [makers](./User%20Management.md#maker-role).

When viewed on mobile, the sections are collapsed and presented in a single list.

## Announcements

The main usage of the homepage is for announcements. Announcements are brief plaintext messages that are displayed to all users. They are useful for relaying updates about the shop such as changes to equipment or hours. 

Announcements can be made, edited, and deleted by [Maker Mentors](./User%20Management.md#mentor-role) or [Staff](./User%20Management.md#staff-role) on the "Announcements" page. If there are multiple announcements, they are displayed chronologically. Announcement content supports markdown formatting.

## Open Hours

The open hours are displayed on the home page, broken up by [Zones](./Equipment%20Management.md#rooms-and-zones). Hours for the respective space are also shown when you click into a [Zone View](#zone-views).

## Available Trainings

The center of the home page shows what trainings are not yet completed by the user, sorted alphabetically. Clicking a training will open it.

!!! note
    Since trainings are sorted alphabetically, and this is a prominent part of the homepage, we suggest purposefully naming general training with a number. For instance, we have the following trainings;

    "0. Introduction to make.rit.edu"

    "1. Access Control Hardware Training"

    "2. Makerspace Safety Policies Quiz"

### Expiring Soon

By default, trainings expire one year after initially passing. Re-completing the training before it has been one year will renew the training timer, and prevent interruption to equipment access. 

Trainings that are approaching the one year cutoff are listed in the "Expiring Soon" section below the "Available Training" section.

## Zone Views

To the left of the "Home" tab, there is a tab for each of the [Zones](./Equipment%20Management.md#rooms-and-zones) in the shop.

Clicking one of these Zone tabs will bring up a list of all equipment in that zone, separated by [Room](./Equipment%20Management.md#rooms-and-zones) if applicable. 

The availability and training progress for each piece of equipment can be seen, same as the "Equipment" page. See [Equipment Management](./Equipment%20Management.md) for more information.

The hours for that specific zone will also be shown.

## Additional Custom Blocks

Additional customized blocks can be added to the homepage based on specific facility needs. For instance at RIT, we included a link to the EHS Lab Safety Training, as well as embedding upcoming events from our Eventbrite account.
