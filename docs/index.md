Welcome to the Access Documentation Website!

This website contains end-user documentation for the RIT SHED Makerspace Access Control System.

To navigate, use the menu on the left to choose a page. Once on a page, there will be a menu on the right to quickly jump to new sections.

See README in the GitHub for more information.

Website under construction, see https://github.com/rit-construct-makerspace/access-control-documentation to see the raw markdown files.
