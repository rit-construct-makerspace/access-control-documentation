# Accessing & Using Equipment

This guide will show you everything you need to do to use a piece of equipment in the SHED makerspace.

# Getting Access to Equipment

## 1. Create Your Makerspace Account.

* Before using any equipment in the makerspace, you must create an account at make.rit.edu.
* Make sure to complete the [Shop Safety Training](https://rit.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/NA3P1PRD0049/common/leclassview/dowbt-0000146117) mandated by RIT Health & Safety before using any makerspace equipment.
* Before using any ACS-controlled equipment, you will need to have your ID card registered. Stop by any of the makerspaces and speak to a member of staff.
    * Until you resolve this, you will see the following error:

* Log in to make.rit.edu.
* Find the piece of equipment you want to use.
    * Equipment page on the left side of the screen.
* The trainings required to use this equipment will be listed. Click on the training to complete it.
* The Standard Operating Procedure can also be found here, and is useful for completing the training.

## 3. Staff Approval

Most equipment in the shop requires approval by staff before using. Once you have completed all online trainings, stop by and talk to a member of staff to complete this in-person practical, it generally takes under 10 minutes. 

!!! note
    Certain equipment, like the mills and lathes, are too complex to cover in a brief competency check. For complex equipment like this, we host regular training workshops. Check make.ri.edu for a list of upcoming training events.

**If the staff give you the OK, you are now set to use the equipment whenever you want!**

# Using ACS-Equipped Equipment

## 1. Sign In to the Space

* Before using equipment in any space, you need to sign in.
* Tap your ID at the front desk to sign in. 
* If the reader makes a "happy beep" and you see a green light, you are set.
    * See staff if it does anything else.
* Sign-Ins are good for the day and for that space only!

## 2. Check if the machine you want is available

* If a device is available but not in use, the light on the front will be **YELLOW**.
    * See [User Quick Reference](User Quick Reference.md#determining-acs-state) to determine machine state based on light color.
* Insert your ID until it stops against the internal stopper
* The light should immediately start flashing, and then turn **GREEN** if you are approved to use the machine.
    * Any other color, see staff for assistance.
