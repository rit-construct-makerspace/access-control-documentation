# Hardware Overview

The ACS Hardware is what enables our Access Control System to actually control access to equipment. The Hardware is generally split into 3 sections;

* The [Core](ACS Core.md) is the heart of an ACS deployment*.
* The [Switch](ACS Switches.md) is the part of the ACS deployment that interfaces with the equipment.
* [Tertiary Components](ACS Tertiary Components.md) are additional optional components in a deployment that add further functionality.

!!! note
    A "deployment" refers to all ACS components deployed on a piece of equipment.
